# Udacity iOS Nanodegree Project (6) - Virtual Tourist (You Decide!)


By Sameer Almutairi

### Project overview
> You will create an app that downloads and stores images from Flickr. The app will allow users to drop pins on a map, as if they were stops on a tour. Users will then be able to download pictures for the location and persist both the pictures, and the association of the pictures with the pin.
